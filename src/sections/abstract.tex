%Derivation of $\coeffA{m}{r}$ in a simple and explicit manner.
Given the polynomial identity
\[
    n^{2m+1} = \sum_{r=0}^{m} \mathbf{A}_{m,r} \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^{r} (n-k)^{r}
\]
we derive and prove the coefficients $\mathbf{A}_{m,r}$ using Binomial theorem and Faulhaber's formula
so that odd-power identity holds.
