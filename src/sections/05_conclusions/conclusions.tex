In this manuscript, we have shown that for every $n\geq 1, \; n,m\in\mathbb{N}$
there are coefficients $\mathbf{A}_{m,0}, \mathbf{A}_{m,1}, \ldots, \mathbf{A}_{m,m}$ such that
the polynomial identity holds
\[
    n^{2m+1} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \mathbf{A}_{m,0} k^0 (n-k)^0 + \mathbf{A}_{m,1}(n-k)^1
    + \cdots + \mathbf{A}_{m,m} k^m (n-k)^m
\]
In particular, the coefficients $\coeffA{m}{r}$ can be evaluated both ways,
by constructing and solving certain system of linear equations or by deriving recurrence relation;
all these approaches are examined providing examples
in the sections~\ref{sec:approach-via-system-of-linear-equations} and~\ref{sec:approach-via-recursion}.
Moreover, to validate the results,
there are supplementary Mathematica programs provided at~\cite{kolosov2023github}.
