One may assume that it is possible to reach the form $n^{2m+1} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \mathbf{A}_{m,0} k^0 (n-k)^0 + \mathbf{A}_{m,1}(n-k)^1
+ \cdots + \mathbf{A}_{m,m} k^m (n-k)^m$ simply taking finite differences of the polynomial $n^{2m+1}$ up to order of $2m+1$ 
and interpolating it backwards similarly as shown in~\eqref{eq:cubes_interpolation}.
However, my observations do not provide any evidence of such assumption.
Interestingly enough is that we could have been arrived to the pure differential approach of the relation~\eqref{eq:odd_power_conjecture} then.
