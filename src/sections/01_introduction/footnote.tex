One may assume that it is possible to reach the form
$n^{2m+1} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \mathbf{A}_{m,0} k^0 (n-k)^0 + \mathbf{A}_{m,1}(n-k)^1
+ \cdots + \mathbf{A}_{m,m} k^m (n-k)^m$
simply taking finite differences of the odd-powered polynomial $n^{2m+1}$ up to order of $2m+1$
and interpolating it backwards similarly as it is shown in the equation~\eqref{eq:cubes_interpolation}.
However, my observations do not provide any evidence that such assumption is correct.
Interestingly enough is that we could have been arrived to the pure differential
approach of the relation~\eqref{eq:odd_power_conjecture} then.
