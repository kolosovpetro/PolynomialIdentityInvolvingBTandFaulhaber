# Polynomial identity involving Binomial Theorem and Faulhaber's formula

Given the polynomial identity
```math
n^{2m+1} = \sum_{r=0}^{m} \mathbf{A}_{m,r} \sum_{k=1}^{n} k^{r} (n-k)^{r}
```
we derive and prove the coefficients $\mathbf{A}_{m,r}$ using Binomial theorem and Faulhaber's formula
so that odd-power identity holds.
